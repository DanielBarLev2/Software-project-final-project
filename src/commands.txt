To run symnmf.py:
choose k (int, < N): Number of required clusters.
choose goal: Can get the following values:
    i. symnmf: Perform full the symNMF and output H.
    ii. sym: Calculate and output the similarity matrix.
    iii. ddg: Calculate and output the Diagonal Degree Matrix.
    iv. norm: Calculate and output the normalized similarity matrix.
choose file_name (.txt): The path to the Input file,
 it will contain N data points for all above goals, the file extension is .txt.

RUN IN CMD: python3 symnmf.py k goal file_name
For debuding: python3 symnmf.py 1 

To run symnmf.c:
choose goal: Can get the following values:
